Code and config files for the simulations performed in the 2012 Biol Cons paper: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.biocon.2012.02.022

Here is the program used for the simulations described in the above paper.
Please note that it depends on an old version of simupop (0.9.3) and now it would be a bit outdated.
In the directory configs/ there is an example configuration file. I will add more configuration files for the different scenarios used in the paper.
